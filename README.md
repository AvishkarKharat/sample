Hello Guys I am MR.AK
And This Is My First Project Which I Want To Share With You.

First all I want to give over view of my project :-
        In this project I used Only Python Language. 
        I creatd this project for only practice perpose 
        so, I can check my knowlage about python 
        language and make my basics more strong.

        In this project I just crated a fun game 
        'Guess The Numer' in which first a computer 
        select a random numer between the range 
        of 1 to 100 an give us 7 attempts to 
        guess that number. if we successed in 
        this then we will win and if not the
        we will lose the game 

        Then what atoping you? just go and play 
        'GUESS THE NUMBER GAME'
                        Let's get started.
